<!-- Section 1 was the hardest because it took me a while to configure the specific sizes and details in the spacing to make it look nice and centered. The other two sections were much easier, just copy/paste the code and then change the info-->

	<h3> 
	Many of the children in the community are forced to take buses to schools in South Slope because there is no space in their local schools. This makes it harder for parents to commute to pick up their children or have a conversation with the teachers. </h3>

	<h3> 
	Because the schools are at maximum capacity, a lot of the resources are scarce. Many children cannot participate in gym class, or take art and music. School lunches have to be served as early as 10:30 to be able to cover all of the students.</h3>

	<h3> The city has designated funding for 6 new schools that will supposedly be built and functioning by 2021. Some believe that it will not be enough, while others argue that parents should be involved in the planning process so that kids can have the best education possible.</h3>
